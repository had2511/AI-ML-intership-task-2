# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an end-to-end exploratory data analysis project on the Titanic dataset, as part of my AI & ML internship. The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), and the analysis was performed using Python in Google Colab.

##  Contents

- `Titanic_EDA_Internship.ipynb` - Google Colab notebook containing:
  - Summary statistics
  - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix, etc.)
  - Pattern analysis and inferences
  - Missing data handling


## Analysis Performed

### Step-by-step EDA:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Missing value identification
- Histograms and boxplots for numeric features
- Correlation matrix and pairplots
- Visual trends by `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age`
- Feature-level insights and interpretations
